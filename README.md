For demo and generating interest in start-up. 


I will change this line four to say something else...trying an example of how conflicts occur and are resolved. 
Then engage with the conflict...



 # REBASE STEPS

1. commit a change on a file.
2. commit another change in a diff file here. 
-- that's to set up the scenario --

3. check git status
4. commit any changes to this READ.md file...or if you are lagging - perform git fetch origin.
check git status to see any conflicts.
5. It's okay... don't freak out... perform git merge origin master.
6. fix conflicts... choose as to which to keep or not. select the best to keep for example. This step involved deleting HEAD============ and whatever you found from the fetch/pull. remove the symbols git created to help us see what is our HEAD and not...
7. save and check git status again.
perform git add -A for all or whatever you are adding...
8. perform git commit -m "message about whatever you fixed to resolve the conflict...
9. git push.
